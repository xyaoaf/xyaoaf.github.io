Welcome to my personal website! I'm Xihan Yao (å§šå¸Œç¿°), a researcher passionate about advancing knowledge at the intersection of GeoAI, high-resolution remote sensing, and humanâ€“environment interactions. My work combines cutting-edge computational methods with environmental science to support climate resilience, urban sustainability, and ecosystem services assessment. I am currently a PhD student in Geography & the Environment at The University of Texas at Austin, where I work in the [GISense Lab](https://sites.utexas.edu/gisense/) directed by Prof. [Yuhao Kang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=amySMvcAAAAJ&hl=en). My research explores how multimodal geospatial data (e.g., satellite & aerial imagery, LiDAR, street view imagery, human mobility) can be integrated with GeoAI methods to understand environmental processes, and human-environment interactions.
