## Instructor of Record

### GEOG/LDARCH C188: Geographic Information Science
**University of California, Berkeley** | Fall 2023

As the instructor of record, I had the privilege of leading UC Berkeley's largest GIS course, serving over 200 students across multiple disciplines. This was one of the most rewarding and challenging experiences of my academic career, requiring careful course design, team coordination, and dedication to student success.

**Course Overview:**
- **Enrollment**: 200+ students from Geography, Landscape Architecture, Environmental Science, Urban Planning, and related fields
- **Format**: Lectures, hands-on labs, and applied group projects
- **Focus**: Foundational and advanced GIS concepts, spatial analysis, remote sensing integration, and real-world applications

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Designed and delivered weekly lectures on GIS theory, spatial data analysis, and geospatial technologies
- Supervised a team of Graduate Student Instructors (GSIs) to ensure consistent and high-quality lab instruction
- Developed course materials, assignments, and assessments that balanced theoretical foundations with practical skills
- Coordinated with 200+ students through office hours, discussion forums, and one-on-one mentoring
- Created final group projects that challenged students to apply GIS methods to real-world environmental and urban planning problems

**Teaching Highlights:**
- Successfully managed one of Berkeley's largest courses while maintaining high student engagement and learning outcomes
- Integrated cutting-edge topics including remote sensing, spatial data science, and emerging GIS technologies
- Showcased exceptional student projects through curated galleries:
  - [StoryMap Collection: Applied Term Projects (StoryMaps)](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/collections/1d41e52a33774245a24ad1287fe21086) - Interactive web maps demonstrating diverse GIS applications
  - [StoryMap Collection: Applied Term Projects (Posters)](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/collections/e378a6792d16476ba9016dc03bb74a0f) - Professional posters showcasing advanced spatial analysis
