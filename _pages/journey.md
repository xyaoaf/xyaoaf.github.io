## Connecting the Dots: A Geospatial Journey Through Place and Space

As a geographer, I believe that understanding place and space is fundamental to understanding our world. This interactive map traces the places that have shaped my academic journey and personal growth.

Each marker represents a significant location in my journey—where I've studied, lived, conducted research, and grown as a scholar and person. Click on any marker to explore my story and connection to that place.

## About This Project

This visualization was created as part of my **Issues in Geography** final project. It explores the concept that every point on a map holds a story—not just coordinates, but relationships, experiences, and transformations.

The map reminds me that:
- Geography is deeply personal
- Places shape who we become
- Our academic journeys are rooted in specific spaces
- Mobility and access to diverse geographic contexts are privileges
- Place-based knowledge illuminates broader geographic phenomena

### Future Additions

I plan to expand this map with:
- Research fieldwork locations
- Conference and presentation venues
- Collaborative networks across institutions
- Environmental projects and case studies
- Cultural and personal experiences that shaped my perspective

*Feel free to reach out if you'd like to know more about any of these places or my experiences there!*
