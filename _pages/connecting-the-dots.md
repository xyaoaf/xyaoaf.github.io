## Connecting the dots

Welcome to "Connecting the dots" - a space where I explore the intersections between different aspects of my research and how various projects, ideas, and experiences come together to form a cohesive vision.

### Research Synergies

Here I discuss how my work in GeoAI, remote sensing, and human-environment interactions creates synergies across different domains:

- **Technology meets Environment**: How cutting-edge AI methods can be applied to solve real environmental challenges
- **Data Integration**: Bringing together diverse data sources (satellite imagery, LiDAR, street view, survey data) for comprehensive understanding
- **Scale Connections**: Linking micro-scale observations to macro-scale environmental processes

### Cross-Disciplinary Insights

My interdisciplinary background allows me to see connections between:

- **Geography and Computer Science**: Spatial thinking enhanced by computational methods
- **Environmental Science and AI**: Using machine learning to understand ecosystem dynamics
- **Planning and Technology**: How geospatial technologies inform better urban planning decisions

### Future Directions

This page will evolve to showcase:

- **Emerging Research Themes**: New directions where my interests are converging
- **Collaborative Opportunities**: How different research streams can be combined
- **Innovation Potential**: Where the intersection of my skills and interests might lead to breakthrough insights
