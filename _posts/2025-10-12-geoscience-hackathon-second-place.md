Excited to share that my team won **Second Place** at the **2025 UT Austin Geoscience Hackathon**!

## Project: Tracking Earth's Changes with AlphaEarth Foundations

**Team Members:** Xihan Yao (myself), Rushi Bhatt, and mentor Dr. Brendon Hall

**Project Theme:** Change over time in Earth's systems

## What We Built

Our team developed an innovative **open-source geospatial AI platform** that leverages Google Earth Engine and DeepMind's AlphaEarth embeddings to detect and visualize land-cover changes at planetary scale.

### Technical Approach

We utilized **AlphaEarth embeddings** — a 64-dimensional representation trained on satellite imagery from 2017-2024 — to capture complex patterns in Earth's surface. By computing dot products between embeddings from different years and applying threshold-based analysis, we can quantify changes across three dimensions:

1. **Temporal**: When did the change occur?
2. **Magnitude**: How significant is the change?
3. **Resolution**: At what spatial scale can we detect the change?

### Real-World Applications

Our platform successfully detects and visualizes diverse environmental changes, including:

- **Urban development**: Construction and demolition of buildings on UT Austin campus
- **Wildfire impacts**: Forest fire scars across California over multiple years
- **Urban sprawl**: Expansion patterns in Austin, Texas
- **Agricultural rotation**: Crop cycling patterns in Central Texas

### Interactive Tool

We developed an interactive dashboard that enables users to:

- Define custom areas of interest
- Compute land-cover changes within seconds
- Visualize results with intuitive visualizations
- Export data for further analysis

This tool makes planetary-scale change detection accessible to researchers, policymakers, and environmental professionals.

## Impact

This hackathon project demonstrates how cutting-edge AI embeddings and cloud-based geospatial processing can unlock new insights into Earth's changing systems. We're excited to continue developing this tool to make it available as a publicly accessible online platform that empowers decision-makers globally.

The combination of state-of-the-art AI models with interactive visualization creates powerful opportunities for environmental monitoring, climate adaptation planning, and sustainable resource management.
