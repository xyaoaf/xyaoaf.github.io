As part of my final project for the **Issues in Geography** class, I created an interactive globe visualization that traces my personal and academic journey across different places. This project, titled *"Connecting the Dots,"* explores the relationship between place and space through my own experiences.

## Project Concept

The interactive map allows viewers to explore the places that have shaped my academic and personal growth. Each location on the globe is marked with a clickable point that reveals a story about my connection to that place—where I've studied, lived, worked, and grown.

This visualization represents more than just geographic coordinates; it's a narrative map of experiences, relationships, and the places that have influenced my perspective as a geographer and researcher.

## Interactive Map

You can explore the full interactive map on the [**Connecting the Dots** page](/journey/).

## Technical Approach

The map was built using Python with **Plotly** for interactive 3D globe visualization. Each marker represents a significant place in my journey, with popup stories that describe:
- Academic experiences and institutions
- Research projects and fieldwork
- Cultural experiences and personal growth
- Connections to local communities and environments

## Reflections on Place and Space

This project reinforced how geography is deeply personal. Each place marker represents not just a location, but a web of relationships, experiences, and transformations. As geographers, we often study human-environment interactions at scale, but this project reminded me that every point on a map contains countless individual stories.

The process of creating this map made me reflect on:
- How different places have shaped my research interests
- The privilege of mobility and access to diverse geographic contexts
- The importance of place-based knowledge in understanding global phenomena
- How personal narratives can illuminate broader geographic concepts
