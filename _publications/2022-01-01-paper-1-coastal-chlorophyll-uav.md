This research develops an innovative UAV-based multispectral remote sensing approach for high-resolution mapping of coastal surface chlorophyll-a concentration, providing valuable tools for marine environmental monitoring and assessment.

**Abstract**: Chlorophyll-a concentration is a critical indicator of marine water quality and ecosystem health. Traditional satellite-based monitoring methods often lack the spatial and temporal resolution needed for detailed coastal studies. This research presents a novel methodology using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with multispectral sensors to map coastal surface chlorophyll-a concentration with unprecedented spatial detail and temporal flexibility.

**Key Contributions**:
- Novel UAV-based multispectral remote sensing methodology
- High-resolution chlorophyll-a concentration mapping capability
- Improved spatial and temporal resolution compared to satellite methods
- Practical validation in coastal environments
- Cost-effective approach for marine environmental monitoring

**Research Impact**: This work contributes to marine environmental science by providing tools for more detailed and flexible monitoring of coastal water quality. The methodology has applications in:
- Marine ecosystem monitoring
- Water quality assessment
- Coastal zone management
- Environmental impact studies
- Aquaculture monitoring

**Citations**: This paper has been cited 18 times, indicating significant impact in the remote sensing and marine science communities.
