This research presents an innovative LiDAR-based methodology for comprehensive three-dimensional urban forest evaluation and microclimate assessment, with practical application demonstrated through a detailed case study in Portland, Oregon.

**Abstract**: Urban forests are critical components of urban ecosystems that significantly influence local microclimates. This study develops and validates a novel methodology that leverages Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology for detailed three-dimensional evaluation of urban forest characteristics and their impact on microclimate conditions. Portland, Oregon serves as the case study location due to its well-established urban forest management programs and diverse tree canopy structure.

**Key Contributions**:
- Novel LiDAR-based methodology for 3D urban forest analysis
- Comprehensive microclimate assessment framework
- Integration of remote sensing with environmental monitoring
- Practical validation through Portland case study
- Methodology applicable to other urban environments

**Research Impact**: This work advances the field of urban forest monitoring by providing tools for more accurate assessment of urban vegetation and its environmental benefits, supporting evidence-based urban forest management and climate adaptation strategies.
