This study develops an innovative approach for community-scale microclimate simulation by integrating Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data with object-based urban tree classification methods. The research demonstrates how high-resolution spatial data can be used to better understand urban microclimates at the community scale.

**Abstract**: Urban forests play a crucial role in regulating microclimates within urban environments. This study presents a novel methodology that combines Airborne Laser Scanning technology with object-based classification techniques to simulate microclimate conditions at the community scale. The approach enables detailed analysis of how urban vegetation influences local temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors.

**Key Contributions**:
- Integration of ALS data with object-based urban tree classification
- Community-scale microclimate simulation methodology
- Improved understanding of urban forest-microclimate relationships
- Practical applications for urban planning and climate adaptation
