This research presents a comprehensive methodology for assessing light pollution impacts in Hong Kong through multi-dimensional measurement techniques and advanced spatial numerical modeling approaches applied at the neighborhood level.

**Abstract**: Light pollution has become an increasingly significant environmental concern in dense urban areas like Hong Kong. This study develops and implements a comprehensive framework for assessing light pollution impacts by integrating multiple measurement dimensions and sophisticated spatial numerical modeling techniques. The research focuses on neighborhood-level analysis to provide detailed insights into integrated light source effects.

**Key Contributions**:
- Multi-dimensional measurement framework for light pollution assessment
- Spatial numerical modeling of integrated light sources
- Neighborhood-level analysis methodology
- Practical applications for urban planning and environmental policy
- Case study implementation in Hong Kong's dense urban environment

**Research Significance**: This work contributes to environmental monitoring and urban sustainability by providing tools for better understanding and managing light pollution in dense urban environments.
