This research presents an exploratory data analysis investigating the complex relationships between urban forests and microclimates in Portland, Oregon, with particular emphasis on understanding multi-scale environmental interactions from local to micro levels.

**Abstract**: Urban forests significantly influence microclimate conditions, but the scale-dependent relationships between forest characteristics and local environmental conditions remain incompletely understood. This study conducts comprehensive exploratory data analysis to examine these relationships in Portland, Oregon, utilizing multiple data sources and analytical approaches to understand how urban forest characteristics vary across different spatial scales and their corresponding impacts on microclimate conditions.

**Key Contributions**:
- Multi-scale exploratory data analysis framework
- Comprehensive examination of urban forest-microclimate relationships  
- Scale-dependent analysis from local to micro levels
- Integration of remote sensing and field measurement data
- Methodological insights for urban environmental research

**Conference Presentation**: This work was presented at the IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS) 2023, demonstrating the growing recognition of urban forest research in the remote sensing community.

**Research Significance**: The findings contribute to understanding how urban forest management decisions at different scales can influence local environmental conditions, supporting evidence-based urban planning and climate adaptation strategies.
